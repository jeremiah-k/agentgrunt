## 🎯 **What AgentOrchestrator Offers**

This fork has been completely transformed into **AgentOrchestrator** - a comprehensive multi-agent development coordination platform that goes far beyond the original AgentGrunt concept:

### ✨ **New Capabilities:**
- **🎼 Multi-Agent Coordination** - Design and orchestrate teams of specialized AI agents
- **📋 Strategic Project Planning** - Break down complex projects with dependency mapping
- **🎯 Advanced Prompt Engineering** - Generate specialized prompts for different agent roles
- **🔄 Dual Deployment Modes** - Bundle mode + standalone mode for maximum flexibility
- **⚡ Quality Assurance Integration** - Built-in validation checkpoints and review processes
- **🛡️ Risk Assessment** - Comprehensive risk planning and mitigation strategies

### 🎼 **The Orchestration Metaphor**
Like a conductor leading a symphony orchestra, AgentOrchestrator coordinates multiple AI agents, each with specialized skills, to create harmonious development workflows.

## 🚀 **Get Started with AgentOrchestrator**

### **Quick Installation:**
```bash
# Install from the new repository
git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor.git
cd agor
pipx install .

# Create your first orchestrated bundle
agor bundle /path/to/your/project
```

### **Two Deployment Modes:**
1. **Bundle Mode** - Upload to any AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. **Standalone Mode** - AI agents clone the repository directly

### **20+ Coordination Commands:**
From strategic planning (`sp`) to team creation (`ct`) to prompt generation (`gp`) - everything you need to orchestrate complex development projects.
